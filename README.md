# Air-Canvas

In the era of Global Pandemic, 'Online World' is the 'New Normal'. The Education system has also adopted Online Mode. The transition from the offline to online mode has opened up many opportunities but the need of Blackboards or Whiteboards has not been fulfilled yet. 
Blackboards plays a major role in concept-involving subjects. Derivations, calculations, diagrams, flowcharts etc are some the few topics which can not be explained with pre-written text materials. 

Therefore, to tackle this problem, this project was developed. It is a project on Computer Vision.

The working principle of the project is very unique and simple. The program first detects the object to be used as the writing object (chalk/Marker). Then, it traces its motion using the webcam. The detected path of the object is traced on the screen and thereby writing on the screen (Blackboards/Whiteboards). When the object is moved in a way to write a word in the air, the word would be traced to the screen. This way, it allows the user to scribble anything in the air and that is traced on the screen
